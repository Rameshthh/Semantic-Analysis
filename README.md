# Semantic Analysis Project

## Overview
This project implements semantic analysis using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It analyzes text data to extract meaningful insights, uncover patterns, and evaluate the sentiment of input data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and tokenizing raw data for better analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Identifying the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of textual input.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representations of sentiment distributions and word frequencies.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the semantic analysis model.

## Project Structure
- **Notebook:** The Jupyter Notebook `Semantic Analysis.ipynb` contains the code and explanations for the project.
- **Data:** The dataset used for training and testing is included in the project directory.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs and plots are generated to better understand the results.
